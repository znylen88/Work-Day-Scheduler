# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
This project was created to show off my new skills using both jquery and moment.js. The objective was to create a simple workday scheduler that saves user input into specific timeslots and remains there even after page refresh. I dealt with a good amount of frustration while working on this project, however I did notice myself becoming more comfortable with the material and how to organize things, specifically in terms of Javascript. I struggled most with figuring out how to keep user input on the page after page refresh. I also became more comfortable with local storage and how it works. Moment.js was a fun library to work with on this project and found it to be fairly simple to add "current date" to the jumbotron. However, using it to change div element color based on time of day was a bit too challenging for me to comprehend so I opted to use Javascript "if" statements to achieve this.

## Usage

Find the current time slot and enter the new task you wish to render to the page. Then click the blue save button to store your new task.
To delete or update a task, simply input a new task or leave the input blank and reclick the blue save button.
The task slots will be rendered as different colors depending on whether it is in the past(gray), present(red), or future(green).
